## Introduction
This project aims to analyze neighborhoods in Mumbai based on their geographical coordinates and venue categories from Foursquare API. Clustering techniques are applied to group similar neighborhoods together for further analysis.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, geopy, geocoder, requests, matplotlib, seaborn, folium, sklearn

Install the required libraries using:
```
!pip install geocoder numpy pandas geopy requests matplotlib seaborn folium scikit-learn
```

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Replace `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in the script with your Foursquare API credentials.

4. Run the notebook `Location_Analyser.ipynb` to execute the analysis and clustering.

## Data Sources
- Neighborhood data sourced from [Wikipedia - List of neighborhoods in Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighbourhoods_in_Mumbai)
- Geographical coordinates obtained using Geocoder library
- Venue data retrieved using Foursquare API

## Methodology
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Geocoding to obtain latitude and longitude coordinates
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Venue exploration using Foursquare API
5. Clustering neighborhoods based on venue categories using K-means clustering
6. Visualization using Folium and matplotlib

## Analysis
- Identifying the most common venue categories in each neighborhood
- Clustering neighborhoods into groups based on venue similarities

## Results
- Visual representation of clustered neighborhoods on a map
- Analysis of each cluster's characteristics and venue categories

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into neighborhood clustering and venue distributions in Mumbai, facilitating better understanding and decision-making for various stakeholders.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance clustering algorithms for more accurate neighborhood grouping
- Include additional features such as demographic data for deeper analysis
- Deploy as a web application for interactive exploration
